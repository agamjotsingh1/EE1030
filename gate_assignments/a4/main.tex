	A multistory building with a basement is to be constructed. The top $4$ m consists of loose silt, below which dense sand layer is present up to a great depth. Ground water table is at the surface. The foundation consists of the basement slab of $6$ m width which will rest on the top of dense sand as shown in the figure. For dense sand, saturated unit weight = $20$ kN/$\text{m}^3$, and bearing capacity factors $N_q = 40$ and $N_{\gamma} = 45$. For loose silt, saturated unit weight = $18$ kN/$\text{m}^3$, $N_q = 15$ and $N_{\gamma} = 20$. Effective cohesion $c^{\prime}$ is zero for both soils. Unit weight of water is $10$ kN/$\text{m}^3$. Neglect shape factor and depth factor.

	Average elastic modlulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\mu$ of dense sand is $60 \times 10^3$ kN/$\text{m}^2$ and $0.3$ respectively.
